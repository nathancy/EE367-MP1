-My program compiles and runs the three versions: Warrior3, Double Warrior3, and Warrior4 correctly.

-queue.c contains the main driver for displaying the output of the three programs. It contains the main driver and the three functions. It outputs the amount blocked for each server system. The file request.dat is also included for simulation purposes. 

-To compile, run "gcc queue.c"

-To run the program, type in "a.out" and input "request.dat"

-The chief engineer should choose the Warrior 4 upgrade because it has the least blocked requests. 

-The value of F for Double Warrior 3 is 5,638,150. The value of F for Warrior 4 is 5,736,500. Both options will results in a marginal improvement in about 5 million dollars but Warrior 4 is slightly better since it brings in about $100,000 more revenue.

-I would choose the Warrior 4 upgrade since it gives the best improvement and most revenue.
